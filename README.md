This project is a Node.js application that listens for incoming webhook requests and plays a corresponding `.wav` sound file when a webhook is received. It is designed to be a simple and customizable alert system that can be integrated with various services that support webhooks.

## Features
- Listens for webhook requests on multiple endpoints (`/webhook`, `/webhook1`, `/webhook2`, etc.).
- Plays a specific `.wav` file for each webhook endpoint.
- Logs incoming webhook data and playback status.
- Easy to set up and extend.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system.
- NPM (Node Package Manager) installed.
- `.wav` sound files placed in the project directory (e.g., `success1.wav`, `error1.wav`, etc.).

---

## General Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhillMckinnon/Play-sound-on-webhook-alert
cd Play-sound-on-webhook-alert
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Sound Files
Place your `.wav` sound files in the project directory. Ensure the filenames match the paths specified in the code (e.g., `alert.wav`, `alert1.wav`, etc.).

### 4. Run the Application
Start the application using Node.js:
```bash
node index.js
```
The application will start listening on port `3000`. You can test it by sending a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/webhook` (or any of the other endpoints).

## Platform-Specific Setup

### Windows
For instructions on setting up the application as a Windows service, see the [Windows Setup Guide](Windows.md).

### Linux
For instructions on setting up the application to run automatically on boot using `cron`, see the [Linux Setup Guide](Linux.md).

---

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can send POST requests to the following endpoints to trigger sound alerts:
- `/webhook` â†’ Plays `success.wav/error.wav`
- `/webhook1` â†’ Plays `success1.wav/error1.wav`
- `/webhook2` â†’ Plays `success2.wav/error2.wav`
- `/webhook3` â†’ Plays `success3.wav/error3.wav`
- `/webhook4` â†’ Plays `success4.wav/error4.wav`

## Customization
- Add more webhook endpoints by duplicating the existing route handlers and updating the `.wav` file paths.
- Modify the port number in the `index.js` file if needed.
- Replace the `.wav` files with your own sound files.

---

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure the `.wav` files are in the correct directory and have the correct filenames.
- Check the console logs for any errors related to file paths or playback issues.
- Make sure the application has the necessary permissions to access the sound files.
